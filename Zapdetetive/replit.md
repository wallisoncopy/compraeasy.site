## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (client-side only)
- **UI Framework**: Vanilla web technologies with no external JavaScript frameworks
- **Styling Approach**: Custom CSS with modern features including:
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
  - CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
  - Gradient backgrounds and backdrop filters for visual effects
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Design System
- **Typography**: Combination of Orbitron (futuristic headings) and Roboto (body text) fonts
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with green accent colors (#00ff64) creating a "hacker/detective" aesthetic
- **Visual Effects**: Heavy use of blur effects, gradients, and box shadows to create a modern, tech-noir appearance
- **Iconography**: Font Awesome 6.0 for consistent iconography

### Page Structure
- **Single Page Application**: The application appears to be structured as a single HTML page
- **Fixed Header**: Navigation with backdrop blur effect and sticky positioning
- **Component-Based CSS**: Organized styling with clear section separation

### Performance Considerations
- **External Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies (only fonts and Font Awesome)
- **Loading Strategy**: CDN-based resource loading for fonts and icons
- **Optimization**: Pure CSS animations and effects without JavaScript dependencies

## External Dependencies
