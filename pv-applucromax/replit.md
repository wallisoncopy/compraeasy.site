## System Architecture

**Frontend Architecture**: Single-page vanilla HTML application with embedded CSS and JavaScript. The design follows a modern, conversion-optimized layout with distinct sections for headline/video, benefits, comparison tables, and pricing offers.

**Design System**: Uses a dark theme with black background (#000000), white text (#ffffff), and green accents (#22c55e for highlights). Typography is based on Google Fonts' Poppins family with multiple weights (300-700). The layout is fully responsive with mobile-first considerations.

**Visual Effects**: Implements a futuristic background using CSS gradients and pseudo-elements with radial gradients for visual depth. The design includes animated elements and smooth scrolling functionality.

**Content Structure**: Organized in logical conversion flow sections:
- Hero section with headline and video placeholder
- Call-to-action scroll button
- Three-column benefits section with icons
- Comparison table (gains vs losses)
- Pricing cards for two tiers (Essencial R$17,90, Premium R$27,90)

**Responsive Design**: Built with CSS flexbox and grid systems, container max-width of 1200px, and mobile-responsive breakpoints.

## External Dependencies

**Google Fonts**: Poppins font family loaded from Google Fonts CDN for consistent typography across devices.

**YouTube Integration**: Placeholder for YouTube video player integration (generic link to be replaced with actual product video).

**No Backend Dependencies**: Pure frontend implementation with no server-side requirements, databases, or external APIs beyond font loading and video embedding.
